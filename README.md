# DevPulse X — The Autonomous Coding Companion

DevPulse X is a next-gen VS Code extension that fuses Baseline compatibility intelligence with smart coding assistance.
It helps developers ship modern, production-safe code instantly — while staying in flow.


---

## 🚀 Why DevPulse X?

Web developers constantly ask: “Is this feature safe to use yet?”
Jumping between MDN, caniuse.com, and blogs wastes time and kills momentum.

DevPulse X solves this.

Instantly checks if a feature is Baseline-safe.

Suggests supported alternatives and polyfills.

Keeps you coding, not Googling.

## 🔑 Features

### 🎯 MVP (Hackathon Build)

Baseline Compatibility Checks
Uses the web-features npm package + Web Platform Dashboard to verify browser support in real time.

Smart Auto-Corrections
One-click fixes for unsupported APIs with suggested polyfills or safe alternatives.

Context-Aware Suggestions
Understands your code structure and offers completions and refactors inline.


### 🌌 Future Roadmap (Post-Hackathon)

Emotion Tracking → detects frustration via typing rhythm, undo streaks, idle time.

Flow Dashboard → visualizes coding rhythm, productivity trends, and mood states.

Autonomous Mode → scaffolds components and micro-features based on project structure.
